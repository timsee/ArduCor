 * color to all connected slots. Colors can be selected by by moving the sliders
 * or by clicking anywhere on the color wheel. A timer is used to throttle the
 * signals to prevent sending messages too frequently.
 *
 * A layout should be set in the constructor that owns a ColorPicker. This
 * layout uses ELayoutColorPicker as a parameter and this can be used to hide the
 * sliders, hide the color wheel, or move the color wheel from the top of the sliders
 * to the left of them.
