 * \brief The LightsSlider class provides a slider with behaviors similiar
 * to sliders on mobile devices. Clicking on the slider jumps the slider's value
 * to the location you clicked instead of the QSlider default of jumping by the page 
 * value. There is also the option to use a gradient instead of a solid color as the 
 * background color for the slider.
 *
 * QSliders can have their tick marks break when the project uses a custom style sheet,
 * so tick marks are drawn using QPaint, if needed.
 *
 * There is also an option for developers to set a value that above the slider's minimum 
 * as the "minmum possible." Users will see a slider that shows the minimum value, but they
 * won't below the value set as the minimum possible. This is used by the Array Colors Page 
 * in order to prevent users from choosing less than 2 colors for the array routines.
