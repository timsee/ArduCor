 * \brief The HueBridgeDiscovery class is an object that handles the discovery of a hue bridge by using
 *        a combination of UDP, HTTP, and JSON parsing.
 *
 *        Upon creation, it checks the persistent app data for the last bridge that was used by
 *        the application. If this passes a validity check, no extra discovery methods are called.
 *        If there is no data or if the current data is not valid, this object begins to go through
 *        the various EHueDiscoveryStates in order to achieve a valid connection. Developers only need
 *        to call startBridgeDiscovery() and stopBridgeDiscovery() in order to control it, it will
 *        automatically handle switching states as it receives and sends discovery packets.
