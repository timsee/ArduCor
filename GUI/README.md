* The style sheet of the project is heavily based on [QDarkStyleSheet](https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet) by Colin Duquesnoy. The major difference between the two is that we do not set the background color as that is handled by QPaintEvents.
* The color wheel's image asset was created by a modified version of the [Python Color Gamut Generator](https://github.com/jacksongabbard/Python-Color-Gamut-Generator) by Jackson Gabbard.
* Code solutions taken from stackoverflow contain links to the original solutions in the source code.
