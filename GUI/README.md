# Qt Lighting GUI for RGB LED Routines

The GUI interacts with the sample arduino sketches. It supports Windows, Mac OS X, Android, and iOS.
It requires on Qt5.2 or later and C++11.

The GUI makes use of Qt5's support for Android and iOS. To use it, set up your Qt Development environment
to work with either android or iOS, attach the device, and build to that target. You may need to update
your user specific settings in Qt in order to recognize the new targets.

The mobile application can be compiled to use either the [HTTP or UDP arduino yun samples]](../samples/yun). 
It cannot be used with the serial samples, since mobile phones aren't really designed to interface
with serial ports. As for screen orientations, It will support portrait and landscape for tablets with an aspect 
ratio of 4:3, such as an iPad. For phones and thinner tablets, only portrait will be supported.

There are a couple of known issues with our current mobile support:

* In Qt versions before iOS 5.5.2, there is a compatibility issue with Apple's bitcode setting. 
To get around this, either install a more recent version of Qt, or go into the Xcodeproj generated by 
Qt Creator and change the enable bitcode setting to off. For more information, [check here](http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/interest/2015-October/019393.html). 
* On android screens with extremely high pixel density, some of the stylesheet and Qt resizeEvents are
still a bit buggy and images may appear smaller than they are intended to be.

* The style sheet of the project is heavily based on [QDarkStyleSheet](https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet) 
  by Colin Duquesnoy. The major differences between our version and the original are that we handle some of the background 
  drawing as QPaintEvents and some of the fixed heights and widths have been removed. 
* The color wheel's image asset was created by a modified version of the [Python Color Gamut Generator](https://github.com/jacksongabbard/Python-Color-Gamut-Generator) by Jackson Gabbard.
* Code solutions taken from stackoverflow contain links to the original solutions in the source code.
