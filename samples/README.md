# Samples

ArduCor has two sets of samples. The first set, [Simple samples](Simple) are designed to show how to get an LED matrix up and running and showing colors in as little code as possible. There are three of these samples: one for Rainbowduinos, one for Neopixels, and one for single RGB LEDs. The second set, [Corluma samples](Corluma) are designed to work with the [Corluma Project](https://github.com/timsee/Corluma). These samples have a messaging protocol with a CRC, and can make use of Raspberry Pis and Arduino Yun for wireless messaging.
