# Simple Sample Sketches for ArduCor

The sample sketches for Adafruit NeoPixels, SeeedStudio Rainbowduino, and a single RGB LED. These samples are designed to show how to get an LED matrix up and running and showing colors in as little code as possible. There are three of these samples: one for Rainbowduinos, one for Neopixels, and one for single RGB LEDs.
